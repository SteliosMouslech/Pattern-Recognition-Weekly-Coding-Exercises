# Pattern Recognition Weekly Coding Exercises  
## About The Repository

This repository contains all my solutions to the weekly exercises that were assigned to me during the 9th semester university subject "Pattern Recognition"
These exercises range from Bayesian  probability and statistics theory to supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning methods.
Code is written in Python 
The project reports are in Greek.

## Week 1 - Random Variables and Optimization
In this exercise 
- We calculate the probability mass function (PMF) of rolling a single die and then calculate the  
mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis of the  random variable
- Create a simulation of throwing in dice and calculating experimentally all the above values using python
- Do the same for 2 dice
- Implement **Gradient descent**  for known function 
- Implement **Newton Method** for  known function

## Week 2 - Probability theory and Bayesian Decision Theory
In this weekly assignment  we solve problems based on Bayesian Decision Theory. 
## Week 3 - Probabilistic Classifiers
In this exercise I create functions to
- Calculate decision boundary function for a known d dimension gaussian distribution with a known a priori   
probability 
- Calculate Euclidian distance for d dimensions
- Calculate Mahalanobis distance  
 
After that we use the above functions to solve problems using **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**

## Week 4 - Non Parametric Estimation , Parzen Windows, K-NN
In this Exercise we create functions for **Kernel Density Estimation** Using **Parzen Windows** and **KNN**. These methods are then used to estimate the probability density function of a random variable

## Week 5 - Linear Classifiers
In this exercise we implement the following algorithms:
- Batch perceptron
- Batch relaxation with margin
- MSE using Pseudoinverse
- Windrow-Hopf (LMS)
- Ho Kashyap
- Kesler Construction

And use them to classify the IRIS flower Dataset
## Week 6 - Support Vector Machines
In this exercise we try different SVM for the IRIS flower Dataset using scikit-learn

## Week 7 - Multi-Layered Perceptrons
Using  scikit-learn we implement different MLP architectures for the IRIS Flower Dataset

## Week 8 - Unsupervised Learning
In this exercise we use:
- K-means clustering
- Fuzzy C-means clustering
- ISODATA clustering  

To cluster the IRIS Flower Dataset
