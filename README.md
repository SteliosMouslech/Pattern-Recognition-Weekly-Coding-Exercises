# Pattern Recognition Weekly Coding Exercises  
## About The Repository

This repository contains all my solutions to the weekly exercises that were assigned to me during the 9th semester university subject "Pattern Recognition"
These exercises range from Bayesian Bayesian probability and statistics theory to supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning methods.
Code is written in Python 
The project reports are in Greek.

## Week 1 - Random Variables and Optimization
In this exercise 
- We calculate the probability mass function (PMF) of rolling a single die and then calculate the  
mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis of the  random variable
- Create a simulation of throwing in dice and calculating experimentally all the above values using python
- Do the same for 2 dice
- Implement **Gradient descent**  for known function 
- Implement **Newton Method** for  known function

## Week 2 - Probability theory and Bayesian Decision Theory
In this weekly assignment  we solve problems based on Bayesian Decision Theory. 
## Week 3 - Probabilistic Classifiers
In this exercise I create functions
- Calculate decision boundary function for a known d dimension gaussian distribution with a known a priori   
probability 
- Calculate Euclidian distance for d dimensions
- calculate Mahalanobis distance 
After that we use the above functions to solve problems using **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**

## Week 4 - Non Parametric Estimation , Parzen Windows, K-NN Kernel
In this Exercise 
## Week 5 - Linear Classifiers

## Week 6 - Support Vector Machines

## Week 7 - Multi-Layered Perceptrons

## Week 8 - Unsupervised Learning
